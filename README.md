Created for my [a star algorithm path finding Tutorial](https://gameidea.org/2023/12/04/pathfinding-using-a-algorithm/). A-star is an optimization algorithm that can be used for problems involving search for better solutions among many available solutions. One of the best use cases are finding shortest path in video games. it is similar to dijkstra algorithm, and low-key also related to DFS, BFS, Greedy-search, best-first-search and other related algorithms.
